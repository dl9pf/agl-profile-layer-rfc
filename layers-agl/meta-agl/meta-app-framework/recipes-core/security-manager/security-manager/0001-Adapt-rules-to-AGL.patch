Subject: [PATCH] Adapt rules to AGL
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

AGL distribution uses the repository https://github.com/01org/meta-intel-iot-security.git
as basis for the integration of security framework. The security framework
that it provides is an evolution of the security framework of tizen refited
to the distribution Ostro of Intel. This refit took the decision to simplify
the model by removing the running label "User". More can be viewed here:
https://github.com/01org/meta-intel-iot-security/pull/116

This commits adapt the template to the rules that are now needed
after this evolution.

It also integrates one other evolutions: the shared label becomes User::App-Shared instead
of User::App::Shared to avoid collision with application of id "Shared".
