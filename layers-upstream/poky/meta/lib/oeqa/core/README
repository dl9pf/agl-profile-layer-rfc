This is the new OEQA framework the base clases of the framework
are in this module oeqa/core the subsequent components needs to
extend this classes.

A new/unique runner was created called oe-test and is under scripts/
oe-test, this new runner scans over oeqa module searching for test
components that supports OETestContextExecutor implemented in context
module (i.e. oeqa/core/context.py).

For execute an example:

$ source oe-init-build-env
$ oe-test core

For list supported components:

$ oe-test -h

Usally for add a new Test component the developer needs to extend
OETestContext/OETestContextExecutor in context.py and OETestCase in
case.py.
